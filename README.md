# 👋 Hi there! I'm Sunjida Haque

🎓 Master's Business Analytics  | 📊 Data-Driven Decision Maker 

---

I've completed master degree in Business Analytics at LUT University, Finland — with a passion for transforming data into decisions that matter.  
I come from a finance background, and now I enjoy working at the intersection of **economics, public policy**, and **data science**.  
When I’m not analyzing datasets, you’ll probably find me brainstorming ideas to solve real-world impact problems.
